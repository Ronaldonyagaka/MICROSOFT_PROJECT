# Overview
This analysis breaks down the threats to entry into the movie industry by Microsoft that is predominantly a technological company and makes recommendations to tackle this.

Insights gained from analysis of selected data sets dictates that Microsoft should use marketing and production strategies used by top  movie studios,

focus their initial movie production to some of the most popular genres.

Huge movie budgets will not necessarily translate to higher returns instead they should look more into qualitative aspects of movie making like writing and hiring seasoned directors.

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

BV and P/DW have carved out a larger market share compared to other studios. As a new entrant into the industry they should be wary when trying to split a portion of the market share since direct competition with the already established studios could have crippling effect for Microsoft Studios.

This graph shows a varied discrepancy between number of movies made and ratings of the particular directors
Sylvia Broeckxx, Erin, and Dennis Korbylo have a higher rating compared to the rest and also a larger number of movies made
This is a visualization of talents in the movie industry with vast experience and high quality work that can be contracted 
to Microsoft's studio debut into the movie industry

#
# CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

These are the recommendation from the analysis above
- Employ talented and experienced directors to spearhead the first slate of movies from Microsoft
  
  this with a combination of good marketing strategies would ensure recognition of the new studio.

- Review expenditure into movie projects as this wont necessarily reap a proportional level of returns
  they should look into other qualitative aspects that translates ticket sales into profits like better writing or story telling, better source material and talented   cast.

- Focus on making popular genres that resonate with the larger audience.

- Benchmark the most popular studios to find out their playbook of what established them as predominant studios and whether they can adopt some of their strategies
